Problem 1:
In the w3 tutorial, you built a class called Person. Make a new class called Robot that does the 
same thing as Person, but includes an attribute called "processing_unit" that is printed after
"Hello my name is <name>". 

So, if the Robot has "name=zuckerberg" and "processing_unit=hpu_v3", when `myfunc` is called, the 
printed output should be:

Hello my name is zuckerberg
My processing unit is hpu_v3
